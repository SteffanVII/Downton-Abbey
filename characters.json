He fought in the South African Wars with John Bates.","He married American heiress Cora Levinson in 1890 in order to save the estate with her money, but eventually fell very much in love with her. They have three daughters together: Mary, Edith and Sybil Crawley; they also had a son lost in a miscarriage. Due to having no living sons, his heir was successively his cousins James Crawley, Patrick Crawley, and Matthew Crawley. The last became his son-in-law via Mary. All three of these heirs eventually died, making his only grandson and Mary and Matthew's only child, George Crawley, his current heir presumptive."],

Eighteen years after the birth of her last child, Sybil, Lady Grantham fell pregnant once again with a son, but miscarried. In 1920, after giving birth to Sybil 'Sybbie' Branson, Sybil died of complications, and Cora blamed her husband, who ignored Dr. Richard Clarkson's warnings in favor of the opinions of stuffy London doctor Sir Philip Tapsell. A year later Cora became a grandmother for the second time when Mary gave birth to a son, George. Within the hour of his birth, George became the heir to his grandfather's title and Downton Abbey as his father, Matthew Crawley, was killed in a car crash. Cora is also grandmother to Edith's illegitimate daughter, Marigold, and Mary's daughter, Caroline Talbot."],
